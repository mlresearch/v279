title: The Intersectionality Problem for Algorithmic Fairness
abstract: A yet unmet challenge in algorithmic fairness is the problem of intersectionality,
  that is,achieving fairness across the intersection of multiple groupsâ€”and verifying
  that such fairnesshas been attained. Because intersectional groups tend to be small,
  verifying whether amodel is fair raises statistical as well as moral-methodological
  challenges. This paper (1)elucidates the problem of intersectionality in algorithmic
  fairness, (2) develops desiderata toclarify the challenges underlying the problem
  and guide the search for potential solutions,(3) illustrates the desiderata and
  potential solutions by sketching a proposal using simplehypothesis testing, and
  (4) evaluates, partly empirically, this proposal against the proposeddesiderata.
