title: Privacy-Preserving Group Fairness in Cross-Device Federated Learning
abstract: Group fairness ensures that the outcome of machine learning (ML) based decision
  making systems are notbiased towards a certain group of people defined by a sensitive
  attribute such as gender or ethnicity. Achievinggroup fairness in Federated Learning
  (FL) is challenging because mitigating bias inherently requires usingthe sensitive
  attribute values of all clients, while FL is aimed precisely at protecting privacy
  by not givingaccess to the clientsâ€™ data. As we show in this paper, this conflict
  between fairness and privacy in FL can beresolved by combining FL with Secure Multiparty
  Computation (MPC) and Differential Privacy (DP). Tothis end, we propose a privacy-preserving
  approach to calculate group fairness notions in the cross-device FLsetting. Then,
  we propose two bias mitigation pre-processing and post-processing techniques in
  cross-deviceFL under formal privacy guarantees, without requiring the clients to
  disclose their sensitive attribute values.Empirical evaluations on real world datasets
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution to train fair andaccurate ML models
  in federated cross-device setups with privacy guarantees to the users.
