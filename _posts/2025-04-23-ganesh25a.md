title: 'Different Horses for Different Courses: Comparing Bias Mitigation Algorithms
  in ML'
abstract: With fairness concerns gaining significant attention in Machine Learning
  (ML), several biasmitigation techniques have been proposed, often compared against
  each other to find thebest method. These benchmarking efforts tend to use a common
  setup for evaluation underthe assumption that providing a uniform environment ensures
  a fair comparison. However,bias mitigation techniques are sensitive to hyperparameter
  choices, random seeds, featureselection, etc., meaning that comparison on just one
  setting can unfairly favour certainalgorithms. In this work, we show significant
  variance in fairness achieved by several al-gorithms and the influence of the learning
  pipeline on fairness scores. We highlight thatmost bias mitigation techniques can
  achieve comparable performance, given the freedomto perform hyperparameter optimization,
  suggesting that the choice of the evaluation pa-rameters—rather than the mitigation
  technique itself—can sometimes create the perceivedsuperiority of one method over
  another. We hope our work encourages future research onhow various choices in the
  lifecycle of developing an algorithm impact fairness, and trendsthat guide the selection
  of appropriate algorithms.
