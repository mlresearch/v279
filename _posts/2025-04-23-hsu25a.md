title: 'From Models to Systems: A Comprehensive Framework for AI System Fairness in
  Compositional Recommender Systems'
abstract: Fairness research in machine learning often centers on ensuring equitable
  performance ofindividual models. However, real-world recommendation systems are
  built on multiplemodels and even multiple stages, from candidate retrieval to scoring
  and serving, whichraises challenges for responsible development and deployment.
  This AI system-level view,as highlighted by regulations like the EU AI Act, necessitates
  moving beyond auditingindividual models as independent entities. We propose a holistic
  framework for modelingAI system-level fairness, focusing on the end-utility delivered
  to diverse user groups, andconsider interactions between components such as retrieval
  and scoring models. We provideformal insights on the limitations of focusing solely
  on model-level fairness and highlight theneed for alternative tools that account
  for heterogeneity in user preferences. To mitigatesystem-level disparities, we adapt
  closed-box optimization tools (e.g., BayesOpt) to jointlyoptimize utility and equity.
  We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposedframework on synthetic
  and real datasets, underscoring the need for a framework thatreflects the design
  of modern, industrial AI systems.
