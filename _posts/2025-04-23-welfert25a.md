title: Fairness-Enhancing Data Augmentation Methods for Worst-Group Accuracy
abstract: Ensuring fair predictions across many distinct subpopulations in the training
  data canbe prohibitive for large models. Recently, simple linear last layer retraining
  strategies,in combination with data augmentation methods such as upweighting and
  downsamplinghave been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance for worst-group
  accuracy, whichquantifies accuracy for the least prevalent subpopulation. For linear
  last layer retraining andthe abovementioned augmentations, we present a comparison
  of the optimal worst-groupaccuracy when modeling the distribution of the latent
  representations (input to the last layer)as Gaussian for each subpopulation. Observing
  that these augmentation techniques relyheavily on well-labeled subpopulations, we
  present a comparison of the optimal worst-groupaccuracy in the setting of label
  noise. We verify our results for both synthetic and largepublicly available datasets.
