title: Improving Bias Metrics in Vision-Language Models by Addressing Inherent Model
  Disabilities
abstract: The integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into various applications
  has high-lighted the importance of evaluating these models for inherent biases,
  especially alonggender and racial lines. Traditional bias assessment methods in
  VLMs typically rely onaccuracy metrics, assessing disparities in performance across
  different demographic groups.These methods, however, often overlook the impact of
  the model’s disabilities, like lack spa-tial reasoning, which may skew the bias
  assessment. In this work, we propose an approachthat systematically examines how
  current bias evaluation metrics account for the model’slimitations. We introduce
  two methods that circumvent these disabilities by integratingspatial guidance from
  textual and visual modalities. Our experiments aim to refine biasquantification
  by effectively mitigating the impact of spatial reasoning limitations, offeringa
  more accurate assessment of biases in VLMs.
