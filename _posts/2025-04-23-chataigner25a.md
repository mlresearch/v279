title: Multilingual Hallucination Gaps
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as alternatives to traditional
  searchengines given their capacity to generate text that resembles human language.
  However, thisshift is concerning, as LLMs often generate hallucinations—misleading
  or false informationthat appears highly credible. In this study, we explore the
  phenomenon of hallucinationsacross multiple languages in free-form text generation,
  focusing on what we call multilingualhallucination gaps. These gaps reflect differences
  in the frequency of hallucinated answersdepending on the prompt and language used.
  To quantify such hallucinations, we used theFActScore metric and extended its framework
  to a multilingual setting. We conductedexperiments using LLMs from the LLaMA, Qwen,
  and Aya families, generating biographiesin 19 languages and comparing the results
  to Wikipedia pages. Our results reveal varia-tions in hallucination rates, especially
  between high- and low-resource languages, raisingimportant questions about LLM multilingual
  performance and the challenges in evaluatinghallucinations in multilingual free-form
  text generation.
